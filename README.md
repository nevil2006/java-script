# JavaScript Practice Projects

This repository contains JavaScript practice files and mini projects created as part of my learning journey.

## Files Included

- `letvariable.js` – Practice with variable declarations
- `miniproject.js` – A small JavaScript project
- `sample.js`, `1.js`, etc. – Miscellaneous exercises

## How to Run

You can run the `.js` files using:
- A browser console (F12 > Console)
- Or a Node.js environment (`node filename.js`)
